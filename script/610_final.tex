\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Study of happiness and its causal factors has been flourished in recent
years. Scholars have studied the relationship between happines and
variables ranging from the political system to cultural and economic
factors to (Inglehart, 2009; Schyns, 1998).This project explores the
relationship between happiness and some candidate variables, namely
marital status, level of family savings, status of heath, and level of
trust.

\section{Methods}\label{methods}

This project drew from survey data from the
\href{http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/WVSContents.jsp}{World Values
Survey}. This is a survey of more than 85,000 respondents across 60
countries and societies around the world. We used data from the most
recent wave which can be accessed
\href{http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/WVSDocumentationWV6.jsp}{here}.
Our data analyses are descriptive and exploratory.\\
\#\# Data analysis and results

\subsubsection{Happiness and trust}\label{happiness-and-trust}

In this section we examine the relationship between happiness and trust.
Johnson (2012) finds that \enquote{trust as measured by the World Values
Survey is positively correlated with experimentally measured trust}.

Out of the total 76222 people, only slightly more than 24.47 percent say
they can trust most of the people around them, while 75.53 are caucious
about the society. Interstingly, there are more people feel happy in
life in the latter group than those in the former. Figure 1, below,
indicates such difference.

\subsubsection{Happiness and health
status}\label{happiness-and-health-status}

Our data suggest a positive correlation between health status and
perceived level of happiness. Figure 2, below, clearly indicates that
most of people who rated their health status as \enquote{good} also felt
happy.

\subsubsection{Happiness and family
savings}\label{happiness-and-family-savings}

Of the 76222 survey participants, the majority (45.48) reported just
getting by financially, while 28.72 saved money. The remainder spent
either some (14.87) or all (10.93) of their savings.

Table 1 shows happiness levels by level of family savings. Relationships
between happiness levels and family savings are explored in Figure 3.
Here, we see that of those reporting the lowest levels of happiness (Not
at all happy, Not very happy), most had spent all of their family
savings. On the other hand, of those reporting the highest level of
happiness (Very happy), the highest percentage were those in the
strongest financial position - those who saved money.

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}

Our results illuminate a number of connections between happiness levels
and other life factors such as trust of others, family financial status,
and health.

Data for happiness levels overall were normally distributed, with the
majority of participants reporting a moderate level of happiness, and
fewer reporting very low or very high levels of happiness. This pattern
continued to be evident when data were grouped by our independent
variables.

Contrary to the conventional belief that people who feel they can trust
people around them should feel more secured, hence happier. The data
shows us somewhat the opposite. Those who say they should be careful
with the fellows surrounding them indicates higher level of happiness.

Results indicate that good health is associated with greater feelings of
happiness. This affirms prior research by Gandelman and
Hern√°ndez-Murillo (2013) which found a strong relationship between
self-rated health status and perceived life quality.

Results also suggest a positive relationship between family financial
circumstances and happiness. Prior research has demonstrated a positive
association between income and well-being, although the mechanisms for
this remain unclear (Diener, 2010). Our results build on this work by
indicating that degree to which families are able to save money, or the
degree to which they must deplete savings and/or take out loans, are
areas worthy of further study.

Our results should be interpreted with caution. Because we are beginners
in using R, data analyses are, so far, only descriptive. Linear models
are needed to explore whether the relationships suggested here are
statistically significant. Furthermore, even if they were, these data
are cross-sectional, so findings cannot be interpreted as indicating
causality.
