# Next step here: we need to figure out how to convert the happiness variable to an integer. Relabling didn't do this, it's still a factor. QUESTION: How do we convert this into an integer? When I try using as.numeric, it keeps coming up with an error message that the object feeling_of_happiness is not found and I don't understand why.
